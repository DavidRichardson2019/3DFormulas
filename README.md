# 3DFormulas
This is an app I made for geometry, it has a list of different shapes that you can view pictures of as well as some basic formulas for, and then solve for those formulas.  Feel free to add a new shape at any time just please follow the layout that the other shapes are in. I am fairly new to git so if I have done something wrong please email me @ david.richardson2019@gmail.com, but go easy on me because again, I am very new! Thanks for your contribution! Also, sorry for the files everywhere, in the xcode project for some reason you cant view the style files and all but one of the calculation files is in the calulations folder in xcode, event hough it still recognizes they are there because everything is styled properly and all of the calculations work. If anyone knows how to reorganize the files both in the actual folder and in the xcode project please do so.
