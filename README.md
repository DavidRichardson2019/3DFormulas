# 3DFormulas
This is an app I made for geometry, it has a list of different shapes that you can view pictures of as well as some basic formulas for, and then solve for those formulas.  Feel free to add a new shape at any time just please follow the layout that the other shapes are in. I am fairly new to git so if I have done something wrong please email me @ david.richardson2019@gmail.com, but go easy on me because again, I am very new! Thanks for your contribution!
